# Foundations I Build #1

## Goal: Build a Random Number Generator

## UX Requirements
* A button element with an ID of `generate`
* A paragraph element with an ID of `random-num`

## Events
* When the button is clicked, generate a random number, and insert it into the `random-num` paragraph

## To Run Tests
* Open your app with Live Server -- make sure your server is running on port 5500
* `npm install`
* `npm test`
* Cypress will open -- you should then click "run 1 integration spec"
